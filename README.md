# Reminders
This is the page where you can add various reminders, such as quizzes, assignments, or just any other things that you may need to do

<p align = "center">

</p>

Pretty blank right now, but you can add a reminder with the "+" button on the bottom right!

<p align = "center">
<img src="/Screenshots/Add.png" width="35%" height="35%">
</p>

Simply fill in all the information fields. 
Both the "Date" and "Time" fields use their respective non-text entry fields

<p align = "center">
<img src="/Screenshots/Calendar.png" width="35%" height="35%">
<img src="/Screenshots/Time.png" width="35%" height="35%">
</p>

After entering evertyhing, your screen should look something like this:

<p align = "center">
<img src="/Screenshots/Filled Add.png" width="35%" height="35%">
</p>

Now just click the save button and a simple version of your reminder should now appear on the screen

<p align = "center">
<img src="/Screenshots/Item In.png" width="35%" height="35%">
</p>

Of course you can add more than just one item

<p align = "center">
<img src="/Screenshots/Item In 2.png" width="35%" height="35%">
</p>

There are also many ways to interact with your reminders

On a single tap, you can view the full version of your reminder

<p align = "center">
<img src="/Screenshots/Single.png" width="35%" height="35%">
</p>

On a double tap, you can edit the different fields of your reminder or delete it

<p align = "center">
<img src="/Screenshots/Double.png" width="35%" height="35%">
</p>

If you want to delete a reminder without going into the editing screen, just hold down the item on the reminders menu and a pop up should prompt you to confirm a deletion

<p align = "center">
<img src="/Screenshots/Long.png" width="35%" height="35%">
</p>

Now if you confirm by clicking "Yes", the item should be gone from your screen

<p align = "center">
<img src="/Screenshots/Deleted.png" width="35%" height="35%">
</p>
